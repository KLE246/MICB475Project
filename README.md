## W5-TM - Week 5 Team Meeting

### Agenda
1. Discuss potential for combining the anemia and feeding datasets. Found that things like sex, weight, height, and age would be shared between the datasets. [EDA findings](https://github.com/KLE246/MICB475Project/blob/main/references/initial_metadata_analysis.xlsx)
2. Discuss some potential questions
3. Creating novel question given our limited overlap between the two sets. Deciding on using one dataset or both

Potential questions:
- Is there a gender-related disparity in the prevalence of anemia in infants, and how might this be related to other factors like dietary habits and infections?
- Are there associations between an infant's dietary habits (appetite, food responsiveness) and anemia status (e.g. growth delays or underweight status) (from the anemia dataset)?
- How do various health parameters (e.g., ferritin levels, hemoglobin) change over time in infants, and can these changes be linked to specific dietary habits or medical interventions?
- At how many months should iron supplements be introduced to an infant’s diet, and how does this alter their dietary habits?
- Are the microbiome changes in the intestines from anemia and diet westernisation comparable? Do these changes affect rates of wasting or stunting?
- Is there a significant weight difference between the two cohorts? If so what is causing this difference? (eg. Iron supplements, feeding type, microbiome)

### Meeting notes:
- Is there a gender-related disparity in the prevalence of anemia in infants, and how might this be related to other factors like dietary habits and infections?
  - This seems novel (according to TA)
  - Combine: controls of anemia dataset, compare dietary habits – assume that kids don’t have anemia?
    - Sex differences between the healthy kids in the anemia dataset (cohort 1), infant dataset (cohort 2)
    - Filter for 6 months, breastmilk feed (?)
    - Look for sex differences with respect to microbiome
    - Compare the two groups: which correlations impacted by what dataset (e.g. which microbes affected by sex)
      - Include dataset as variable
  - For both, approach would be similar

### Tasks for the week
- Finalize dataset and research question
- Start proposal outline
    - Split responsibilities
- \(stretch goal\) Load all data and begin QIIME work
